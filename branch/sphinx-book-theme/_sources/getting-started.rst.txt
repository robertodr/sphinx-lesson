Getting started
===============

From scratch
------------

You can get started by making a Sphinx project and configuring the
extension.  This is explained in the next page.

Demo lessons
------------

This guide can't currently stand alone.  It is probably better to see
and copy the real lesson demos to get started:

* The sphinx-lesson-template repository
  (https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template) is
  currently the best empty repository to start from.  There is nothing
  here but the raw files you need.

* Github without the command line is a complete lesson using the
  theme: https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/ .
